During development of my first iteration of creating a Board component, I went for a MVP implementation of a visual showing the path from each Tile. Two Tiles would not have a connection if there was a wall in between.




Before working further on the functionality, I decided I wanted a different visualisation of the Board, and landed on each Tile being split into 9 parts, to create a better looking display
